# ICF Training

Repo with demo jobs and homework for the ICF team's OpenFn onboarding training

*Note that commits to `main` will be auto-deployed to OpenFn.org. Always work on a branch!*

## Getting started with the Repo

1. create `/tmp` folder locally with a `state.json` file that you don't commit to github
2. start writing and testing jobs locally with the relevant adaptor
